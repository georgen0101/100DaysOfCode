# 100DaysOfCode
This repository contains all of the projects that I completed as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## About the Course
100DaysOfCode is a free online course that challenges you to code for 100 days in a row. The course is designed to help you learn new programming skills and build your confidence as a python developer.

## Projects
The projects in this repository are organized by day. Each day, I completed a new project, which I documented in a README file. The README files include a description of the project, the code, and any instructions for running the project.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to this repository. If you have any ideas for new projects, or if you find any errors in the existing projects, please feel free to open a pull request.
