# Day 7: Hangman Game
Today I learned and practiced the following concepts:

- For/IN & While Loops
- IF / ELSE
- Python lists
- The strings
- The range function
- The modules

I also created a flow chart for the hangman game and learned about the IN keyword for the loops and conditionals.

## For/IN & While Loops
For loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a string. While loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is met.

## IF / ELSE
IF statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program. ELSE statements are used to provide an alternative block of code to execute if the condition of the IF statement is not met.

## Python Lists
Python lists are a data structure that can store a sequence of elements. Elements in a list can be of any type, including other lists.

## The strings
Strings are a data type that represents a sequence of characters. Strings can be manipulated using a variety of methods, such as len(), upper(), and lower().

## The range function
The range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. The range function can be used to iterate over a sequence of numbers in a for loop.

## The modules
Modules are a way to organize code in Python. Modules can be imported into other Python programs.

## New things
I created a flow chart for the hangman game. This helped me to visualize the logic of the game.
I learned about the IN keyword for the loops and conditionals. The IN keyword can be used to check if a value is contained in a sequence.
Conclusion
I learned a lot about Python programming today. I am now able to create more complex programs, such as the hangman game. I am excited to continue learning Python and to create even more challenging programs in the future.
